### **Azure Day 3: Resource Manager and Resource Groups**

#### **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**
The **Azure Resource Manager** (ARM) is the control plane that enables you to deploy, manage, and organize resources in Azure. Think of ARM as the middle layer that processes your requests and interacts with Azure services to create the desired resources.  

**How It Works:**  
1. A user (e.g., a DevOps Engineer) receives a request to provision a resource, such as a Linux Virtual Machine (VM).  
2. The engineer specifies the properties of the VM and submits the request through a tool or script (e.g., Azure CLI, PowerShell, or Azure Portal).  
3. The request is forwarded to ARM, which processes it and provisions the specified resource in Azure.

#### **Resource Groups**
A **Resource Group** is a logical container used to group related Azure resources, making it easier to manage, track, and organize resources in a project or environment.  

**Key Points:**  
- Assigning a resource to a resource group is **mandatory** when creating Azure resources.  
- Resource groups help in tracking resource usage and managing access efficiently, especially in organizations with multiple teams or projects.

**Best Practices for Resource Groups:**  
1. **Environment-Based Grouping:**  
   - Create resource groups for different environments (e.g., Development, QA, Production).  
   - Example: `project-name-dev`, `project-name-qa`, `project-name-prod`.  

2. **Project-Based Grouping:**  
   - Group resources by project to maintain clarity and facilitate collaboration.  
   - Example: A QA resource group might include test databases, virtual networks, and storage accounts.

3. **Cost Management:**  
   - Resource groups help track costs and usage by associating resources with specific groups, simplifying budgeting and reporting.

#### **Resource Provisioning Flow**
1. **Create a Resource:** Specify the type of resource you need (e.g., Linux VM).  
2. **Define a Resource Group:** Assign the resource to a specific resource group for tracking and management.  
3. **Deploy Using ARM:** Azure Resource Manager handles the request and provisions the resource as specified.
