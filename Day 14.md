## üöÄ **Kubernetes Deployment Options for a DevOps Engineer on Azure**

When deploying containerized applications using Kubernetes, a DevOps Engineer has three main options:

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ On-Premises Deployment (Private Cloud like OpenStack)**

- **Setup**:
  - Kubernetes cluster is deployed on an on-premise data center.
  - VMs are manually provisioned:  
    - **3 Control Plane nodes** (Master nodes)  
    - **2 Development Plane nodes** (Worker nodes)

- **Management**:  
  - **Fully self-managed**: all upgrades, patching, and scaling must be handled manually by the DevOps team.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Azure Virtual Machines (Self-Managed Kubernetes on Azure)**

- **Setup**:
  - DevOps engineer provisions **5 VMs** directly via Azure:
    - **3 for Control Plane**
    - **2 for Development Plane**
  
- **Management**:
  - Kubernetes cluster is still **self-managed**, but Azure provides tools and partial support for upgrades.
  - More scalable than on-premises with **auto-scaling configurations available**.
  - DevOps engineer is responsible for configuring integrations and network security.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS ‚Äì Fully Managed Kubernetes)**

- **Setup**:
  - DevOps engineer requests a **Kubernetes cluster via AKS**.
  - Azure handles **Control Plane** for you ‚Äì you only manage the **Development Plane (Worker nodes)**.

- **Management**:
  - **Fully managed**: Azure takes care of upgrades, scaling, high availability, and monitoring.
  - Built-in integration with Azure services (like Azure Monitor, Azure AD).
  - Simplified security and faster deployments.

## üîç **Comparison Table**

| Parameter         | On-Premises                 | Azure VMs (Self-Managed K8s) | Azure AKS (Managed K8s)    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Maintenance**   | Fully manual (complex)      | Semi-automated                | Fully automated (easy)     |
| **Cost**          | Low (if infra is available) | Moderate (Azure VM costs)     | Pay-as-you-go              |
| **Scaling**       | Manual                      | Configurable auto-scaling     | Built-in auto-scaling      |
| **Integration**   | Requires CSI, plugins       | Manual integrations needed    | Easy with Azure ecosystem  |
| **Security**      | Manual setup (vulnerable)   | Needs strong configuration    | Azure-enforced security    |
| **Upgrades**      | Manual                      | Partially supported           | Automated                  |
| **Best Use Case** | Legacy infra, full control  | Custom setups with flexibility| Cloud-native deployments   |

## üîê **Security Considerations**

- **On-Premises** and **Self-Managed Kubernetes on Azure VMs** have **higher security risks** if not configured properly.
- **AKS** benefits from Azure‚Äôs built-in security policies, **RBAC**, **integrated Azure AD**, and **network policies**, making it more secure by default.
