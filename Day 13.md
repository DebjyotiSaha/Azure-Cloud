## 🌐 **Azure DevOps Overview**

**Azure DevOps** is a comprehensive platform developed by **Microsoft** that provides a suite of tools and services tailored for **DevOps Engineers**. It enables teams to **streamline the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**, improving both the **efficiency and speed** of project delivery.

## 🔄 **What is SDLC?**

The **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** outlines the process followed by development teams to deliver software effectively. It includes the following stages:

1. **Planning**
2. **Design**
3. **Development**
4. **Testing**
5. **Deployment**
6. **Maintenance**

🔹 Without DevOps: This cycle may take **2–3 months**  
🔹 With DevOps practices: It can be shortened to as little as **1 month**, due to **automation, integration, and collaboration**.

## 🚀 **How Azure DevOps Enhances SDLC**

Azure DevOps brings all the required tools under **one unified platform**, allowing teams to **plan, develop, test, deploy**, and **monitor** applications in a structured, collaborative manner.
